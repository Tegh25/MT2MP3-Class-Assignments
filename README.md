# MT2MP3-Class-Assignments

## Description

This repository preserves and displays all my class work, assignments, and my final exam solutions from my second-year Programming for Mechatronics course, all written in C.

The assignments and questions are separated into the following structure (A3 and A4 were skipped):

- A1: C Programming Basics
  - Q1
  - Q2
  - Q3
  - Q4
  - Q5
  - Q6
  - Q7
- A2: More Advanced C Programming
  - Q1
  - Q2
  - Q3
  - Q4
  - Q5
- A5: Pointers and Data Structures
  - Q1
  - Q2
- Final Exam:
  - Q1
  - Q2
  - Q3
  - Q4
  - Q5

The answers to each assignment question has been commented and made readable in a way that the purpose of the code can be determined without reading the question. In most of the C files, the main function has been intentionally left blank as it was not being tested. The final exam questions have been included in the folder as a pdf file.

This repo will no longer be updated as I have passed this class.
